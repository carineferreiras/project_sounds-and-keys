# project_sounds-and-keys
The project is a function that plays the sound of musical instruments that are stored inside an HTML audio element. We made those sounds that were reproduced there in our graphical interface, by the buttons that we designed with HTML and CSS. The interface image was ready and we just made our buttons work and reproduce the sound of the instrument we wanted.
